1. Create a virtual environment for your bot and install all the required libraries into it.
2. Now create two folders in the same folder where you've extracted the code ; named 'downloads' and 'google-images-download' 
3. Then use this url to add your discord bot to your server, make sure you have the required permissions  
    https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=923871651433676831&permissions=8&scope=bot
4. After adding , run the bot.py file and then you're ready to use the bot.
